        This stock analysis app uses a machine learning model to make predictions based on historical stock data. 
        The stock prediction model works by:

        1. Loading historical stock data for a selected company, including price and volume information.

        2. Analyzing and visualizing this data to identify patterns, trends, and moving averages in the stock's performance over time.

        3. Utilizing a pre-trained LTSM Model, to make predictions about future stock prices based on historical patterns and data.

        4. Comparing the model's predictions with actual stock prices to evaluate its accuracy and performance.

        This model is designed to provide insights into possible future stock price trends, but it's important to note that stock markets are influenced by various factors, and predictions are not guaranteed.

        Enjoy using the Stockx Analysis App!
